<h2>Little Guy Brand Guide</h2>

<p>The concept of the brand is a cat cafe - a place where people can come to enjoy drinks and small meals in the presence of cute, friendly cats.</p>
<p>The fonts I am using are Martel by Dan Reynolds for the bulk of the text, and Prata by Cyreal for anything I need to be more stylized such as headers.</p>
<p>As for colors I am using teal for the background, alice blue for the main text, and light green for accents with the intent of making a pleasant, cool-toned environment for the user.</p>

<p id="mission">The mission of Little Guy Cafe is to provide joy to both humans and cats by bringing them together.</p>
