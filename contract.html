	<h2>Course Contract</h2>
	
		<p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Maia L. Bailey</a> agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2022 WEB115-N801 Web Markup and Scripting with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>
		<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
		<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as an absences.</p>
		<p>Signed: Maia L. Bailey, 19 August 2022</p>
